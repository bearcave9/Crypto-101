Kernel programming vs system programming vs device driver programming.

1. Kernel developers focus on interfaces, data structures, algorithms,
   and optimization for the core of the operating system.

2. System programmers write daemons, utilities, and other tools for 
   automating common or difficult tasks.

3. Device drivers use the interfaces and data structures written by the
   kernel developers to implement device control and IO.
